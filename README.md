# xk6-redis

This is a Redis client library for [k6](https://github.com/grafana/k6),
implemented as an extension using the [xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6) system.

| :exclamation: This is a proof of concept, isn't supported by the k6 team, and may break in the future. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! |
|------|

Note that there is already a [k6 Redis extension](https://github.com/dgzlopes/xk6-redis)
that uses a different Go library and slightly different API. The extension in this
current repo served as an example for an [xk6 tutorial article](https://k6.io/blog/extending-k6-with-xk6),
but using one or the other is up to the user. :)

## Build

To build a `k6` binary with this extension, first ensure you have the prerequisites:

- [Go toolchain](https://go101.org/article/go-toolchain.html)
- Git

Then:

1. Install `xk6`:
  ```shell
  go install go.k6.io/xk6/cmd/xk6@latest
  ```

2. Build the binary:
  ```shell
  xk6 build --with github.com/grafana/xk6-redis
  ```

## Example test script

```javascript
// test.js
import redis from 'k6/x/redis';

const client = new redis.Client({
  addr: 'localhost:6379',
  password: '',
  db: 0,
});

export default function () {
  client.set('mykey', 'myvalue', 0);
  console.log(`mykey => ${client.get('mykey')}`);
}
```

Result output:

```shell
$ ./k6 run test.js

          /\      |‾‾| /‾‾/   /‾‾/
     /\  /  \     |  |/  /   /  /
    /  \/    \    |     (   /   ‾‾\
   /          \   |  |\  \ |  (‾)  |
  / __________ \  |__| \__\ \_____/ .io

  execution: local
     script: test.js
