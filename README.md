# xk6-redis

This is a Redis client library for [k6](https://github.com/grafana/k6),
implemented as an extension using the [xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6) system.

| :exclamation: This is a proof of concept, isn't supported by the k6 team, and may break in the future. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! |
|------|

Note that there is already a [k6 Redis extension](https://github.com/dgzlopes/xk6-redis)
that uses a different Go library and slightly different API. The extension in this
current repo served as an example for an [xk6 tutorial article](https://k6.io/blog/extending-k6-with-xk6),
but using one or the other is up to the user. :)

## Build

To build a `k6` binary with this extension, first ensure you have the prerequisites:

- [Go toolchain](https://go101.org/article/go-toolchain.html)
- Git

Then:

1. Install `xk6`:
  ```shell
  go install go.k6.io/xk6/cmd/xk6@latest
  ```

2. Build the binary:
  ```shell
  xk6 build --with github.com/grafana/xk6-redis
  ```

## Example test script

```javascript
import { check } from 'k6'
import http from 'k6/http'
import redis from 'k6/x/redis'
import exec from 'k6/execution'

export const options = {
    scenarios: {
        redisPerformance: {
            executor: 'shared-iterations',
            vus: 10,
            iterations: 200,
            exec: 'measureRedisPerformance',
        },
        usingRedisData: {
            executor: 'shared-iterations',
            vus: 10,
            iterations: 200,
            exec: 'measureUsingRedisData',
        },
    },
}

// Instantiate a new redis client
const redisClient = new redis.Client({
    addrs: new Array('localhost:6379'),
    password: 'foobar',
})

// Prepare an array of crocodile ids for later use
// in the context of the measureUsingRedisData function.
const crocodileIDs = new Array(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

export function measureRedisPerformance() {
    // VUs are executed in a parallel fashion,
    // thus, to ensure that parallel VUs are not
    // modifying the same key at the same time,
    // we use keys indexed by the VU id.
    const key = `foo-${exec.vu.idInTest}`

    redisClient
        .set(`foo-${exec.vu.idInTest}`, 1)
        .then(() => redisClient.get(`foo-${exec.vu.idInTest}`))
        .then((value) => redisClient.incrBy(`foo-${exec.vu.idInTest}`, value))
        .then((_) => redisClient.del(`foo-${exec.vu.idInTest}`))
        .then((_) => redisClient.exists(`foo-${exec.vu.idInTest}`))
        .then((exists) => {
            if (exists !== 0) {
                throw new Error('foo should have been deleted')
            }
        })
}

export function setup() {
    redisClient.sadd('crocodile_ids', ...crocodileIDs)
}

export function measureUsingRedisData() {
    // Pick a random crocodile id from the dedicated redis set,
    // we have filled in setup().
    redisClient
        .srandmember('crocodile_ids')
        .then((randomID) => {
            const url = `https://test-api.k6.io/public/crocodiles/${randomID}`
            const res = http.get(url)

            check(res, {
                'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
                'content-type is application/json': (r) =>
                    r.headers['content-type'] === 'application/json',
            })

            return url
        })
        .then((url) => redisClient.hincrby('k6_crocodile_fetched', url, 1))
}

export function teardown() {
    redisClient.del('crocodile_ids')
}

export function handleSummary(data) {
    redisClient
        .hgetall('k6_crocodile_fetched')
        .then((fetched) => Object.assign(data, { k6_crocodile_fetched: fetched }))
        .then((data) => redisClient.set(`k6_report_${Date.now()}`, JSON.stringify(data)))
        .then(() => redisClient.del('k6_crocodile_fetched'))
}
```

Result output:

```shell
$ ./k6 run test.js

          /\      |‾‾| /‾‾/   /‾‾/   
     /\  /  \     |  |/  /   /  /

## API

xk6-redis exposes a subset of Redis' [commands](https://redis.io/commands) the core team judged relevant in the context of k6 scripts.

### key/value operations
  - **`set(key: String, value: any) -> Promise<String>`**: set the given key with the given value.
  - **`get(key) -> Promise<String>`**: Get returns the value for a given key.
  - **`del(keys: String[]) -> Promise<Number>`**: removes the specified keys. A key is ignored if it does not exist. Returns the number of keys that were removed. 
  - **`exists(keys: String[]) -> Promise<Number>`**: returns the number of key arguments that exist. Note that if the same existing key is mentioned in the argument multiple times, it will be counted multiple times.
  - **`incr(key: String) -> Promise<Number>`**: increments the number stored at `key` by one. If the key does not exist, it is set to zero before performing the operation. An error is returned if the key contains a value of the wrong type, or contains a string that cannot be represented as an integer. Returns the value of key after the increment.
  - **`incrby(key: String, increment: Number) -> Promise<Number>`**: increments the number stored at `key` by `increment`. If the key does not exist, it is set to zero before performing the operation. An error is returned if the key contains a value of the wrong type, or contains a string that cannot be represented as an integer.
  - **`decr(key: String) -> Promise<Number>`**: decrements the number stored at `key` by one. If the key does not exist, it is set to zero before performing the operation. An error is returned if the key contains a value of the wrong type, or contains a string that cannot be represented as an integer.
  - **`decrby(key: String, decrement: Number) -> Promise<Number>`**: decrements the number stored at `key` by `decrement`. If the key does not exist, it is set to zero before performing the operation. An error is returned if the key contains a value of the wrong type, or contains a string that cannot be represented as an integer.
  - **`expire(key: String, seconds: Number) -> Promise<Boolean>`**: sets a timeout on key, after which the key will automatically be deleted. Note that calling Expire with a non-positive timeout will result in the key being deleted rather than expired.
  - **`ttl(key: String) -> Promise<Number>`**: returns the remaining time to live of a key that has a timeout.
  - **`persist(key: String) -> Promise<Boolean>`**: removes the existing timeout on key.
  - **`random() -> String`**: returns a random key.

### List field operations
- **`lpsuh(key: String, values: Array<any>) -> Promise<Number>`**: inserts all the specified values at the head of the list stored at `key`. If `key` does not exist, it is created as empty list before performing the push operations. When `key` holds a value that is not a list, and error is returned.
- **`rpush(key: String, values: Array<any>) -> Promise<Number>`**: inserts all the specified values at the tail of the list stored at `key`. If `key` does not exist, it is created as empty list before performing the push operations.
- **`lpop(key: String) -> Promise<String>`**: removes and returns the first element of the list stored at `key`.
- **`rpop(key: String) -> Promise<String>`**: removes and returns the last element of the list stored at `key`.
- **`lrange(key: String, start: Number, Stop: Number) -> Promise<String[]>`**: returns the specified elements of the list stored at `key`. The offsets start and stop are zero-based indexes. These offsets can be negative numbers, where they indicate offsets starting at the end of the list.
- **`lindex(key: String, start: Number, stop: Number) -> Promise<String>`**: returns the specified element of the list stored at `key`. The index is zero-based. Negative indices can be used to designate elements starting at the tail of the list.
- **`lset(key: String, index: Number, element: String)`**: sets the list element at `index` to `element`
- **`lrem(key: String, count: Number, value: String) -> Promise<Number>`**: removes the first `count` occurrences of `value` from the list stored at `key`. If `count` is positive, elements are removed from the beginning of the list. If `count` is negative, elements are removed from the end of the list. If `count` is zero, all elements matching `value` are removed.
- **`llen(key: String) -> Promise<Number>`**: returns the length of the list stored at `key`. If `key` does not exist, it is interpreted as an empty list and 0 is returned.
 
### Hash field operations
- **`hset(key: String, field: String, value: String) -> Promise<Number>`**:  sets the specified field in the hash stored at `key` to `value`. If the `key` does not exist, a new key holding a hash is created. If `field` already exists in the hash, it is overwritten.
- **`hsetnx(key: String, field: String, Value: string) -> Promise<Boolean>`**: sets the specified field in the hash stored at `key` to `value`, only if `field` does not yet exist. If `key` does not exist, a new key holding a hash is created. If `field` already exists, this operation has no effect.
- **`hget(key: String, field: String) -> Promise<String>`**: returns the value associated with `field` in the hash stored at `key`.
- **`hdel(key: String, fields: String[]) -> Promise<Number>`**: deletes the specified fields from the hash stored at `key`.
- **`hgetall(key: String) -> Promise<[key: string]string>`**: returns all fields and values of the hash stored at `key`.
- **`hkeys(key: String) -> Promise<String[]>`**: returns all fields of the hash stored at `key`.
- **`hvals(key: String) -> Promise<String[]>`**: returns all values of the hash stored at `key`.
- **`hlen(key: String) -> Promise<Number>`**: returns the number of fields in the hash stored at `key`.
- **`hincrby(key: String, field: String, increment: Number) -> Promise<Number>`**: increments the integer value of `field` in the hash stored at `key` by `increment`. If `key` does not exist, a new key holding a hash is created. If `field` does not exist the value is set to 0 before the operation is set to 0 before the operation is performed.

### Set field operations
- **`sadd(key: String, members: Any[]) -> Promise<Number>`**: adds the specified members to the set stored at key. Specified members that are already a member of this set are ignored. If key does not exist, a new set is created before adding the specified members.
- **`srem(key: String, members: Any[]) -> Promise<Number>`**: removes the specified members from the set stored at key. Specified members that are not a member of this set are ignored. If key does not exist, it is treated as an empty set and this command returns 0.
- **`sismember(key: String, member: Any) -> Promise<Boolean>`**: returns if member is a member of the set stored at key.
- **`srandmember(key: String) -> Promise<String>`**: returns a random element from the set value stored at key.
- **`spop(key: String) -> Promise<String>`**: removes and returns a random element from the set value stored at key.

### Custom operations

In the event a redis command you wish to use is not implemented yet, the `sendCommand(command: String, args: Array<any>) -> Promise<any>` method can be used to send a custom commands to the server.
